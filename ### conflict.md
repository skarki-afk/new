### conflict
Git can handle most merges on its own with automatic merging features. A conflict arises when two separate branches have made edits to the same line in a file, or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other. Conflicts will most likely happen when working in a team environment.

## create and switch branch
```
    git branch branchname
    git checkout -b branchname 
```
